I am Pierre Lebrun, a full remote French engineer passionate about Kubernetes and cloud native technologies, specialized in multi-cloud as well as on-premise, air-gapped environments.

I've lived in Japan for over a decade before moving back to France, together with my lovely wife and daughter.

Throughout my career I evolved from a full-stack developer to a DevOps engineer, and eventually a site reliability engineer. 

Exploring the cloud native landscape became my passion as I never stop researching and experimenting the latest technologies and tools.
